## About me

I have always been interested in programming, but I received my education in a different field. I can describe myself as very motivated and hardworking person who is committed to continuous learning and improvement. Some time ago I became interested in front-end development, watching videos, reading and trying to do something myself.
I have no doubt that by starting to study with your course, I will receive all the most necessary knowledge and experience. My goal is to successfully complete the course, build a productive and effective portfolio, and become a good junior front-end developer who will always develop herself to become even better!
